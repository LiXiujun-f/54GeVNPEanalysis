To read the simulated pi0/eta->gamma v2 and spectra:
    root calgamma.C
In this macro, the spectra (dN/dpTdY)  already scaled with the branchratio.

I find one problem is the pt weight, because I sample the flat pt in [0,30],
flat y in [-1.5,1.5]
which means if I donot add any cut, the final dN/dpTdy is 1./3./30, so when
setting the weight one need to renormalize it (and it is also the case for
combine the embedding.)
